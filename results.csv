Leading Internet backbone Hurricane Electric seeks a Network Software Engineer to work on several Internet network related software projects involving BGP, BGP flow spec, sflow, netflow, and global Internet routing analysis. These services will be composed of backend components that are operational or analytical and simple web interfaces as the front end.

To be considered for this position you must have past software engineering experience involving processing or creating any one or more of the following: 1) BGP route or flowspec announcements, 2) BGP routing table data, 3) sflow/netflow data, 4) a system that produced geoip data (not just a client that used geoip data).

Ideally you know a suitable low level backend language such as C, Go, or Rust that can be used to write or otherwise modify existing BGP daemon (for making or ingesting BGP announcements/withdrawals) or sflow/netflow processing daemons, and a few scripting languages (for easier programming tasks, such as making quick web based tools for our staff, customers, or the public). Also you are expected to have a working knowledge of SQL as well as any other database languages you prefer to use depending on the situation.

Hurricane Electric's Internet backbone network connects to over 9200 networks in 45 countries.

Our customers are Internet companies and large Internet networks.

We develop and maintain tools for network engineers to use such as: http://bgp.he.net http://lg.he.net http://he.net/layer2 http://he.net/3d-map

Responsibilities:

    Write a simple web interface front end and a network protocol related (i.e. BGP, sflow, etc) back end for several different Network Software projects.

Requirements:

    2+ years software engineering involving BGP, BGP flowspec, and/or sflow/netflow
    4+ years software engineering
    Solid knowledge of UNIX and TCP/IP network fundamentals
    Practical knowledge of protocols such as: IPv6, ARP, DNS, DHCP, HTTP, SSH, SNMP
    Knowledge of C, Go, or Rust required (to be able to write low level code to speak or ingest BGP or sflow messages).
    Knowledge of PHP, Python, Ruby, Perl, or Javascript a plus.
    Because this is a programming job, there will be one or more reasonable coding assessments. We apologize in advance for needing you to do this, we get many applicants with a very wide range of experience and competency. You can't tell just by looking at somebody's degree or by their communication skills during an interview whether they can program.
    Must have prior work experience using SQL and Linux.
    2+ years of experience working directly or indirectly with networks in a 24x7 production environment a plus.
    Experience working directly or indirectly with Cisco, Juniper, Extreme/Brocade, or Arista routers and switches a plus.
    Hands-on experience with network diagnostic tools such as ping, traceroute, mtr, iperf, dig, and whois
    Possess excellent verbal/written (English) communication skills

    Meet and communicate with parents - many of whom will be techies themselves, who work at some of the best companies and startups in the area.
    Meet and communicate with school teachers, PTA parents, and local businesses to create opportunities for kids to code.
    Be a part of and learn from a passionate team of 5 GMs (We are a franchisee of the greater organization; 2 of our 5 are top 3 in the nation) fueled by our mission to get more kids to code! 
  
  This is a full-time position. A typical school's open hours are weekdays 3:30-7:30pm and Saturdays 10am-3pm, but GMs work outside of these hours regularly. Our top GM’s labor of love keeps them busy throughout the week and they earn six figures from salary and profit share.

Responsibilities
The GM is the person in charge of the day-to-day operations and growing the school. The key responsibilities are to:
  
   Ensure students are having an engaging and productive learning experience.   
  Make families happy (via smooth operations: scheduling, customer service, staffing, etc.).   
  Grow the community (via Sales & Marketing activities and team culture).
  

Requirements
Candidates must be:
  
    Excited about coding for kids. You genuinely believe in our mission to get kids coding and have an easy time inspiring others to join the cause. Coding has impacted your life in a big way and you want to pay it forward to the next generation.
    Organized techie.  You have a natural sense of orderliness/organization and have a comfort of multitasking across multiple web applications (keep track of a complex schedule for hundreds of students, HR, events, sales & marketing processes using a myriad of web applications). You don’t need to know how to code but the idea of adopting new programs and platforms to streamline your work piques your curiosity.
    Driven.  You are excited by growing a business and are constantly figuring out ways to bring in new students.
    Decisive. You are comfortable making quick, logical decisions under pressure while balancing a variety of priorities.
    Great with people, especially kids. We are a people-centric business from managing our young adult coaches to establishing relationships with parents and members of your community.
  

Nice to have
Great candidates may also be:

  Experienced in CS & education. We can train you on how to hire and manage your technical coaches if you are not technical, but a technical and education (tutoring or the like) background to support the students learning experiences and even coach students several hours per week may be helpful.
A community ring-leader. You love to bring people together by organizing activities and events. This is a coding community where we can create new camps, hack-a-thons, workshops, game nights etc to expand the school’s presence in the community.

  Naturally inclined to outreach. The best GMs are natural advocates for our mission and thrive on outreach and community building. Sky is the limit with revenue sharing if you are organized and you like to grow.

About UsAt Saildrone, we sustainably explore, map and monitor the oceans to understand, preserve, and protect our world. Saildrone designs and manufactures wind and solar powered autonomous surface vehicles called Saildrones, which make cost-effective ocean data collection possible at scale. We work with governments, civic agencies, foundations, universities, and private companies around the globe to drive better information about our oceans and seas - be it in sailing drones into the eye of a Category 4 hurricane to obtain new scientific storm data, mapping out the ocean floor, collecting new CO2 data in hard-to-reach areas, counting biomass to establish fishing quotas, or detecting and stopping illegal fishing and drug trafficking. As a result of our work, we have been selected as one of the ""Forbes Top 10 Wonders of 2021"", as well as the Smithsonian Institute's ""Top 10 Ocean Stories of 2021"", New York Times' ""Top 21 Things that happened (for the first time) in 2021"", and Popular Science's ""100 Greatest Innovations of 2021"".
